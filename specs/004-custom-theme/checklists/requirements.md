# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Theme Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — all ambiguous points from the feature description (exact editable color set, meaning of "standard Google sharing options", export vs. import scope, theme count limits) had reasonable defaults grounded in the app's existing renderer roles and existing `share_plus`-based sharing pattern for setlists. These are recorded in the Assumptions section.
- All checklist items pass on first validation pass.
